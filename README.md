## 279: Introduction to JSX and Babel

This section introduces JSX and Babel.

**JSX** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

**Babel** in react operates as a transpiler, converting the latest JavaScript syntax into a version that can run in all environments. This is done by converting the latest JavaScript syntax into an older version that is supported by all browsers.
